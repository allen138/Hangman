# Word-Guess-Game

Awwww yes! The almighty Hangman Game! This is a word guessing game with a theme of Rock n' Roll bands.

You have 10 tries to guess each letter for the secret word shown.
For each letter that is guessed correctly, it will display on the corresponding blank spot(s) for that specific word. 
If you guessed them all correctly, an alert will pop up saying "You Win!", and the image will change to an album cover of the artist.

If you run out of guesses, than you guessed it, an alert will pop up saying "You Lose!" and the game will reset.

The game will keep track of your wins and your losses, so have fun and Good Luck!
